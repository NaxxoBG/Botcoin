# Botcoin
A bot created with the Discord4J API for Discord bot development. It presents the users with information regarding different cryptocurrencies. Currently it supports a small number of cryptocurrencies but can be easily extended to include more. The users interact with the bot through chat commands, as it is added as a member of the chat server.
